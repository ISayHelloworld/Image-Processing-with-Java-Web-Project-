# Image-Processing-with-Java-Web-Project-
I develop a image-joint function in website, it can joint hundreds of small pictures to be a big "puzzle" based on the picture you upload. The framework is J2EE and tomcat, and I publish the website into Linux Server. The link is www.capic.club/Capic_Web24  you can try by uploading your own JPG image to make your "puzzle" in the web. It's only a course project, so I didn't do a lot of debugging in it, just verify that the main function is feasible.
